Quiver - How To Play



Wanna start your first Quiver game? Here are the basic infos that you need to know before playing.

Before launching
You can change your keybinds, your language and the music/sound volume in the Options menu, before launching a game. No worries, you'll have access to this menu when playing, but in order to follow well the dialogs, we advice you to do your changes before creating a new game.
When initializing your first Quiver game, you'll need to name your game, give yourself a nickname and select a character between the Mage, the Rogue and the Paladin. Be aware that these characters have their own stats, and are played differently. All the character infos are visible in the New Game menu.

After launching
You'll arrive in a place where you can move with your preset settings, and where the history will begin. Also, don't forget to look at the dialogs, that's important.

Exploration
After reading the story, the (real) game will start. Just keep exploring the dungeons and you'll finish the game. Yeah, it's that simple.

Monster Fighting
Actually, it's not that simple. There are monsters in the dungeon and they will do everything to kill you. But you're brave, and you will fight them. The fighting system is pretty simple: it's a round-by-round system, in which you'll use your character's abilities against the monster's abilities. Warning: there are several types of monsters, and they do not have the same abilities. Mostly of their abilities will hurt you, and all your abilities require mana points to be used. If you don't have mana, you can only flee, and lose 8 health points. So, keep a look on your HUD!
When you defeat an enemy, you'll gain recovery health and mana.

Good luck, young explorer!
