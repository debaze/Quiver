Quiver Updates History



Alpha Updates



210108 - 01/08/21

This is the first ever-created version of Quiver. There was only a few UI designs and some useless buttons. The game initial name was Dungeon Quest!

210118 - 01/18/21

Quiver just gets its first level, which was the dungeon entrance! There was not textures, but the main menu could launch a game. There was some textures like the relief texture on the buttons, the darkbrick menu texture and the scroll appearance for the secondary menus. By the way, we were experiencing the very first motion and collision tests on the game.

210120 - 01/20/21

Added some infos at the top of the backup content (game name, nickname, current level, etc.).

210122 - 01/22/21

Rewrite of the generator and motion engines and some bug fixes.

210124 - 01/24/21

The user now needs to inform all the text fields on the New Game menu, like the game name, the class, etc.

210125 - 01/25/21

Addition of the first level design textures like brick, wood, etc. Even if the collisions with all the objects are disabled, there are collision barriers around the level so the player can't quit the map.

210129 - 01/29/21

The loading menu with that (beautiful) counter clock has just been added! Thanks Paint 3D. Really. No. I hate Paint 3D.

210207 - 02/07/21

Welcome to this incredibly beautiful main menu background. Thanks LÃ©an :). Also, the update brings the first 2.5D textures to the game. The dungeon entrance is fully designed! Just, the collisions are missing but no worry! These will come soon :D

210220 - 02/20/21

Just some texture updates, like chests. I like chests. Oh, and the counter clock from the loading menu is now finished. Oh, and also the character stats are into the game and ready to be used!

210301 - 03/01/21

The biggest alpha update, by far. The site is now on Hostinger, at https://quivergame.000webhostapp.com. The player HUD has been added, as well as the dialogs and the mobs. The collisions are finished and work well. The player can pass levels, fight monsters and grab the... wait, I don't want to spoil you! Play the game before.



Release Updates



1.0.0 - 03/07/21

This is the first released version of Quiver. The game is hosted and playable at https://quivergame.000webhostapp.com. This address is not intended to change.
Quiver 1.0.0 is quite different from its earlier versions. The website had a scaling system which had to set the window scale to 16/9, which was the only supported ratio. The UI was a little different too: the New Game menu and the Launch Backup menu were separated, and the graphic interface was a bit less conscientious. Also, Quiver had not sounds. They'll be implemented with the next update.

1.1.0 - 05/30/21

This update brings a lot of changes: the source code had been fully re-written, and we added some animations, languages (English, Spanish and French - maybe other languages will be added with the next updates :D) and options. You can now choose your keybinds, regulate the volume of the in-game and music sounds and change your language. The history, the dialogues, the maps and the enemies are the same than that of the previous version. With this update, Quiver is twice as light as before!

1.1.1 - 08/17/21

A small update in which we added a little guide to learn the basics, as well as the update changelog you're reading right now :)

1.1.2 - 12/10/21

Somes changes about the code lisibility. You'll no longer see these green weird progress bars on other browsers than Firefox!
